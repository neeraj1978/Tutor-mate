# TutorMate - Video Script (3 Minutes)

## 0:00 - 0:30: The Problem
**Visual**: Split screen. Left side: A stressed student looking at a pile of textbooks. Right side: A teacher buried under grading papers.
**Audio**: "Every student learns differently, but traditional classrooms can't adapt to everyone. Students fall behind because their specific weak concepts go unnoticed, and teachers are too overwhelmed to provide personalized 1-on-1 tutoring for every single student."

## 0:30 - 1:00: Introducing TutorMate
**Visual**: Logo animation "TutorMate". Then show the Architecture Diagram (Ingest -> Diagnose -> Practice -> Track).
**Audio**: "Enter TutorMate. An AI-powered educational intelligence system built on Google Vertex AI and Gemini. It's not just a chatbot; it's a multi-agent system that acts as a dedicated personal tutor."
**Visual**: Highlight "Diagnostic Agent", "Practice Agent", "Progress Tracker".
**Audio**: "TutorMate diagnoses exactly *why* a student is struggling, generates custom practice problems to fix those specific gaps, and tracks mastery over time."

## 1:00 - 2:00: The Demo (Screen Recording)
**Visual**: Screen recording of the Jupyter Notebook or Terminal running `run_demo.py`.
**Audio**: "Let's see it in action. Here, we ingest a student's recent quiz."
**Visual**: Show JSON input (Student answers).
**Audio**: "The Diagnostic Agent uses Gemini to analyze the mistakes. It doesn't just check for correct answers; it identifies that the student is struggling specifically with 'Linear Functions'."
**Visual**: Show the "Diagnosis" output in the terminal.
**Audio**: "Immediately, the Practice Agent generates a personalized set of new problems, tailored to this concept, with increasing difficulty."
**Visual**: Show the "Practice Set" output.
**Audio**: "And the Explanation Agent provides a simple, analogy-based explanation to clear up the confusion."
**Visual**: Show the "Explanation" output.

## 2:00 - 2:30: Long-term Impact
**Visual**: Show the "Teacher Report" and a graph of "Mastery Score" going up.
**Audio**: "But it doesn't stop there. TutorMate remembers. The Memory Bank tracks progress over weeks. The Scheduler Agent uses spaced repetition to ensure the student retains what they've learned."
**Visual**: Show the "Memory Bank" database or a visualization of it.
**Audio**: "Teachers get a high-level summary, allowing them to intervene only when necessary."

## 2:30 - 3:00: Conclusion
**Visual**: TutorMate Logo + "Built with Google Vertex AI".
**Audio**: "TutorMate empowers students to master concepts at their own pace and gives teachers their time back. Built with the power of Gemini and the flexibility of the Agent Development Kit. This is the future of personalized education."
**Visual**: "Thank You!"
